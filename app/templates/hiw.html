            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The eight puzzle game is a simple game consisting of a 3x3 grid (9 squares). Each
                square has a number, 1-8, with the last square being a blank square, non-existent, or zero
                square. The goal of the game is to move the squares of the puzzle, using the empty
                space, to order the numbers for a specific goal state. Typically the goal state is to have
                the numbers ordered sequentially, top to bottom. Figure 1 represents a sample puzzle
                and the appropriate steps to solve it.

            <h3>Algorithms Used</h3>
            <p>
                The three algorithms that can be used are: Uniform Cost Search, A* with the Misplaced
                Tile Heuristic, and A* with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic
            </p>

            <h4>Uniform Cost Search</h4>
            <p>
                This search algorithm is the most basic of the three and is simply A* with h(n)
                hardcoded to 0. This algorithm expands the cheapest node, with a cost of g(n). For this
                project, the expansions contain no weights and each expanded node has a cost of 1.
                This algorithm essentially works similarly to Breadth-First Search.
            </p>

            <h4>A* with the Misplaced Tile Heuristic</h4>
            <p>
                This search algorithm expands on Uniform Cost Search by adding a heuristic to make it
                more efficient. The algorithm checks for how many numbers in the initial puzzle are
                "misplaced" in comparison to the goal state. Figure 2 contains an example of what that
                may look like:
            </p>

            <!--Insert image here-->
            <figure class="figure">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='puzzle.png') }}" class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Sample initial and goal state">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><b>Figure 2:</b> Sample puzzle with misplaced tiles</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                The number of misplaced tiles is set to h(n). This does not include the blank/zero tile in
                the puzzle. For this example, the tiles containing 3, 8, and 1 are misplaced, giving us
                a h(n) of 3. Using this, the search algorithm will expand nodes with the cheapest cost or
                h(n) value instead of expanding each node in the queue, thus making it more efficient
                than Uniform Cost search.
            </p>

            <h4>A* with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic</h4>
            <p>This algorithm expands on the previous, but with a different heuristic. It continues to
                look for the number of misplaced tiles, but checks for the number of tiles each
                misplaced tile is away from its respective goal state position. This heuristic also does
                not take into account the position of the empty square. Using the example puzzle in Figure 2, the tiles containing ‘3’, ‘8’, and ‘1’ are misplaced.
                Based on their positions in the puzzle and their goal state positions we can calculate
                h(n) to be 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
            </p>

            <h3>Comparison of Algorithms on Sample Puzzles</h3>
            <p>To test the accuracy and speed of each algorithm, I used the following test cases:</p>

            <!--Insert image here-->
            <figure class="figure">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='puzzles.png') }}" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Sample puzzles of varying difficulties">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><b>Figure 3:</b> Sample puzzles of varying difficulties solved in this report</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                When solving puzzles with low depths, such as depth 0, 2, 4, or 8, the program runtime
                between the three algorithms was mostly the same with very little discrepancy. This was
                expected of the algorithms since the puzzles were very simple and the algorithms only
                had to look through a small number of puzzles/nodes to find the solution. For instance in
                Figure 4 we can see that the 3 algorithms are able to solve puzzles 0-3 in under a
                second, with a very small discrepancy between the three.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this was not the case when it came to puzzles of large depth. Uniform cost
                search doesn’t use any heuristics to minimize the number of nodes to search through,
                so it ends up looking through every node of the queue. This is really apparent when
                attempting to solve a puzzle of large depth since there are hundreds of puzzles to look
                through. Both the Misplaced Tile heuristic and Manhattan Distance heuristic do a great
                job of reducing the runtime of the algorithm. The difference between both of these
                algorithms is very minimal, with the largest gap being about 3 seconds when solving a
                puzzle of depth 20. Figure 4 displays the runtime (in seconds) for each algorithm solving
                each of the sample puzzles shown above (minus the depth 24 one).

            <p>
                In this table we can see a clear discrepancy in time between Uniform Cost search and
                the two heuristic searches at puzzles with depths 16 and 20. Interestingly, the
                algorithms run at very similar speeds at puzzles with depths 0 to 8. A small gap is first
                shown at puzzle 4 when it comes to Uniform Cost search versus the other two,
                however, this gap is very minor and negligible. This table goes to show how much more
                efficient heuristic searches can be for problems of large depth/complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we can see a clear difference in efficiency between the three algorithms
                when looking at maximum queue size and the number of nodes expanded by each
                algorithm on each puzzle. Figure 5 below shows the number of nodes expanded by
                each algorithm when going through puzzles of various depths.
            </p>

            <!--Insert graph here-->
            <figure class="figure">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graph1.png') }}" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Graph of number of nodes expanded vs solution depth">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><b>Figure 4:</b> Number of nodes expanded vs solution depth graph; smaller number of nodes expanded = more efficient algorithm</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                The number of nodes expanded by the three algorithms is negligible at puzzles of
                depths 0 to 8. At depth 12 we see a jump in difference between Uniform Cost Search
                and the other two searches. This number then grows exponentially for UCS for puzzles
                of depth 16 and 20, most likely continuing to grow exponentially for larger depths. Misplaced Tile and Manhattan Distance Searches grow a bit, however, do not see a
                major spike in their number of nodes like UCS did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, Figure 6 below shares the same story regarding efficiency between the three
                algorithms. The three share similar results for queue size on puzzles of depths 0 to 8.
                UCS sees a jump at depth 12 and continues to grow exponentially for depths 16 and up.
                However, Misplaced Tile search and Manhattan Distance search do not seem as big of
                a jump.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Considering the three algorithms implemented in this project and comparing each one
                to each other, we can conclude that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The three algorithms performed roughly similarly for most puzzles. A difference in
                    efficiency between the three algorithms is noticeable around puzzles of depth 12
                    and higher.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uniform cost search does poorly with complex puzzles with large depths due to
                    having to look through all nodes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Misplaced tile and Manhattan heuristics do a stellar job of improving the
                    efficiency of the search. The difference between the two at large depths is not too
                    big, however, whether or not you choose to implement one over the other is
                    up for debate
                </li>
